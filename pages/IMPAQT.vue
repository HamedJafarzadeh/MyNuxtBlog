          Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) is gaining popularity due to its sustainability, environmental
          impacts
          minimization and economical promotions. <a href="https://impaqtproject.eu/"> IMPAQT </a> is a European project
          aimed at promoting and supporting inland,
          coastal zone and offshore IMTA development. As a part of IMPAQT project, we are developing a novel
          biotelemetry platform in WSN Group of <a href="http://www.tyndall.ie"> Tyndall national institute </a>. Our
          platform is consist of Underwater Transmitter Nodes (UWTN)
          and receiver gateway nodes to provide an underwater sensors networks platform to monitor and
          analyze marine environments. Each UWTN is capable of
          integrating sensors
          such as accelerometers and temperature sensors, that can be immersed in water and IMTA sites to monitor water
          flows,
          seaweeds movements and marine animalsâ€™ activities.

          <b>1- What is the problem that we are focusing on?</b>
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="mt-3 ml-4">
          Real-Time (Instant) wireless aquatic monitoring sensors, currently few companies provide products real-time
          underwater monitoring systems, they are mostly expensive or need wires to communicate
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="mt-3" style="color: darkorchid">
          <b>2- What do we offer?</b>
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="mt-3 ml-4">
          Simply, <b>we are trying to eliminate the need for the wire using our novel miniaturized ultrasonic
          transceiver modules </b> , which results in unlocking the potential for various technologies and sensing
          methods, such as real-time monitoring of fish health, seaweed or water quality. Our second target is to build
          novel, miniaturized sensors based on our miniaturized transceiver modules. We are hoping to help farmers in
          following areas : Non-stop, real-time monitoring of the sites, Early disease detection using <b>respiratory
          frequency monitoring, feeding optimization, fish stress detection</b> and <b>seaweed growth optimization </b>.
          However, we
          are at the early stage of technology development; these points are the hypothesis that we are planning working
          on.

          Currently, <b>we have the prototype of our system ready</b>. We are working closely with our partners in the
          IMPAQT
          project, Marine Institute and others, to test and improve the devices. We will also deploy some of the
          developed sensors in West Galway for data collection and testing soon.

          <b>At the moment we are looking for any potential stakeholders to discuss with</b>, regarding what they need
          most,
          what would be the optimal solution they are looking for and what would be their ideal definition of a novel
          miniaturized monitoring sensor. We are also open to any partnership from the industry for collaboration on the
          problems and providing the solutions. We would be happy to plan a virtual meeting (considering the current
          pandemic situation) to talk more in details.

          Why our project is important ?
        </h2>
        <p align="justify" class="mt-3">
          With the advancement of communication technologies, it is now possible to transmit a
          data over
          hundreds of kilometres in the air using electromagnetic waves, however as soon as the medium changes from air
          to
          water, communication range using electromagnetics drops to few meters in freshwater and less than a meter in
          seawater due to water properties and conductivity which makes the implementing of underwater wireless sensors
          networks challenging. RF, acoustic and optical communication links are the commonly used methods of underwater
          communications. However, the conductivity of water can cause severe attenuation and absorption to the RF
          signals. To
          tackle this issue, high power transmitter and large antenna size are required, which is not suitable for most
          aquaculture monitoring applications. Optical communications need a clear line of sight, and acoustic
          communication
          suffers from limited bandwidth, propagation delay, and multipath effect. In this research project, we are
          studing the the
          challenges of
          developing an underwater telemetry platform and we are developing a novel
          telemetry platform to tackle the discussed issues.
