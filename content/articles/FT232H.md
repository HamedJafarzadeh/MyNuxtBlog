First Check all the connection and make sure it fitted well enough.

Check with a USB connector and windows should be able to detect the device and you can see in the picture attached that it detected a FTDI chip with USB Serial Converter name. 

> If it was not detected, download VCP driver from FTDI driver section.

Download FTProg software and try to scan the ports, you should be able to find the FTDI chip, similar to picture below

if you cannot connect, make sure that all usb serial connection (VCPs ...) are disconnected and no terminal is using FT232 chip.

using the FT Prog try to activate the FT245 Mode as follow :

## Activate FT245 asynchronous mode

- Scan and Parse first

- Select following option

- Click on Devices > Program menu and then click Program to save the configurations

- FT245 Asynchronous communication works with with VCP and also D2xxx drivers, but I suggest stick to VCP as it is easier to use

- FT245 Synchronous works only with D2xxx, refer to the next image

# Tips

- Always add some delays before sending data to PC using FT232, it let the FT232 to finish the usb enumeration and prevent odd behaviour. In my case I was receiving huge noise on all usb ports and my mouse was moving crazy and clicking every where. I added a 5s delay before sending first batch of data and it resolved my issue.
