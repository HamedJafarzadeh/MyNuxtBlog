# Isolated battery voltage measurements

## High percision accuracy solutions
### First solution
Broadcom ACPL-C87x **Precision Optically Isolated Voltage Sensor**

- ACPL-87A or ACPL-87B or ACPL-870 are not different in functioning

### Second solution
- Use a microcontroller on one side and measure the voltage and send the data through a isolated communication link such as CAN or RS485

## Low percision accuracy solution
### Using Voltage level indicator ICs
We can use these Voltage level indicators as follows

and then instead of normal LEDs, we can connect them to optocouplers and get the voltage level on the other side.

### Using Zener and Optocouplers
We can use Zeners as follows for determining the voltage level

and then instead of normal LEDs, we can connect them to optocouplers and get the voltage level on the other side.
